Here is a translation in English:

Verily Qarun was of the people of Musa; then he behaved arrogantly toward them. And We had vouchsafed him of the treasures whereof the keys would have weighed down a band of strong men. Recall what time his people said unto him: exult not; verily God loveth not the exultant. (76) And seek the abode of the Hereafter with that which God hath vouchsafed thee, and forget not thy portion in the World, and be thou bounteous even as God hath been bounteous unto thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; verily Allah loveth not corrupters. (77) He said: I have been vouchsafed this only because of the knowledge that is with me. Knew he not that Allah had destroyed before him, of the generations, those who were stronger than he in might and larger in respect of following? And the culprits shall not be questioned of their sins. (78) Then he went forth unto his people in his pomp. Those who sought the life of the world said: would that we had the like of that which hath been vouchsafed unto Qarun! Verily he is the owner of a very great fortune. (79) And those who had been vouchsafed the knowledge said: woe unto you! the reward of Allah is best for him who believeth and worketh righteously and none shall attain it except the patient. (80) Then We sank the earth with him and his dwelling-place. And he had no host to defend him against Allah,nor was he of those who could defend themselves. (81) And those who had wished for his place but yesterday began to say: Ah! Allah expandeth the provision for whomsoever He will of His bondmen and stinteth, had not Allah been gracious unto us, He would have sunk the earth with us also. Ah! the infidels thrive not. (82) This is the abode of the Hereafter! We appoint it unto those who Seek not exaltation in the earth nor corruption; and the happy end is for the God-fearing. (83) Whosoever bringeth good shall have better than it, and whosoever bringeth evil, then those who do ill works shall be rewarded only for that which they have been working. (84)

Based on the provided text, I have crafted a moral and educational story for children aged 6 to 10 years old.
Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a wealthy man named Karim. Karim possessed incredible treasures, so much so that even the strongest men in the village would struggle to carry the keys to his treasure chambers. Despite his wealth, Karim was a proud and arrogant man.
One day, the village elders gathered around Karim and advised him not to be so boastful about his wealth. They reminded him that showing off was not appreciated and that it's important to be humble. They also advised him to use his wealth to do good deeds, help others, and be kind, just as the Creator had been kind to him.
Karim listened to the elders but didn't take their advice to heart. Instead, he believed that his wealth and success were due to his own knowledge and intelligence. He continued to flaunt his riches in front of the villagers.
One sunny day, Karim paraded around the village, dressed in his finest clothes and adorned with gold and jewels. Some villagers, who were envious of his wealth, wished they could have the same fortune as him. Others, who possessed wisdom, warned the envious villagers that true happiness comes from faith, good deeds, and patience.
As Karim continued to ignore the elders' advice, the earth suddenly opened up beneath him and his luxurious home, swallowing them whole. The village people were astonished by the

Qarun was doubtless, of the people of Moses; but he acted insolently towards them: such were the treasures We had bestowed on him, that their very keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men: behold, his people said to him: "Exult not, for Allah loveth not those who exult (in riches). (76) "But seek, with the (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on thee, the Home of the Hereafter, nor forget thy portion in this world: but do thou good, as Allah has been good to thee, and seek not (occasions for) mischief in the land: for Allah loves not those who do mischief." (77) He said: "This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which I have." Did he not know that Allah had destroyed, before him (whole) generations― which were superior to him in strength and greater in amount (of riches) they had collected? But the wicked are not called (immediately) to account for their sins. (78) So he went forth among his people in the (pride of his worldly) glitter. Said those whose aim is the life of this World: "Oh that we had the like of what Qarun has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune." (79) But those who had been granted (true) knowledge said: "Alas for you! the reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is best for those who believe and work righteousness: but this none shall attain, save those who steadfastly persevere (in good)." (80) Then We caused the earth to swallow him up and his house; and he had not (the least little) party to help him against Allah, nor could he defend himself. (81) And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow: "Ah! it is indeed Allah Who enlarges the provision or restricts it, to any of His servants He pleases! Had it not been that Allah was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Ah! those who reject Allah will assuredly never prosper." (82) That House of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high-handedness or mischief on earth: and the End is (best) for the righteous. (83) If any does good, the reward to him is better than his deed; but if any does evil, the doers of evil are only punished (to the extent) of their deeds. (84)

Here is a french version of the same text:

En vérité, Coré [Karoūn] était du peuple de Moïse mais il était empli de violence envers eux. Nous lui avions donné des trésors dont les clefs pesaient lourd à toute une bande de gens forts. Son peuple lui dit: «Ne te réjouis point. Car Allah n’aime pas les arrogants. (76) Et recherche à travers ce qu’Allah t’a donné, la Demeure dernière. Et n’oublie pas ta part(1) en cette vie. Et sois bienfaisant comme Allah a été bienfaisant envers toi. Et ne recherche pas la corruption sur terre. Car Allah n’aime point les corrupteurs». (77) Il dit: «C’est par une science que je possède que ceci m’est venu». Ne savait-il pas qu’avant lui Allah avait fait périr des générations supérieures à lui en force et plus riches en biens? Et les criminels ne seront pas interrogés sur leurs péchés»(1)! (78) Il sortit à son peuple dans tout son apparat. Ceux qui aimaient la vie présente dirent: «Si seulement nous avions comme ce qui a été donné à Coré. Il a été doté, certes, d’une immense fortune». (79) Tandis que ceux auxquels le savoir a été donné dirent: «Malheur à vous! La récompense d’Allah est meilleure pour celui qui croit et fait le bien». Mais elle ne sera reçue que par ceux qui endurent. (80) Nous fîmes donc que la terre l’engloutît, lui et sa maison. Aucun clan en dehors d’Allah ne fut là pour le secourir, et il ne pût se secourir lui-même. (81) Et ceux qui, la veille, souhaitaient d’être à sa place, se mirent à dire: «Ah! Il est vrai qu’Allah augmente la part de qui Il veut, parmi Ses serviteurs, ou la restreint. Si Allah ne nous avait pas favorisés, Il nous aurait certainement fait engloutir. Ah! Il est vrai que ceux qui ne croient pas ne réussissent pas». (82) Cette Demeure dernière, Nous la réservons à ceux qui ne recherchent, ni à s’élever sur terre, ni à y semer la corruption. Cependant, l’heureuse fin appartient aux pieux. (83) Quiconque viendra avec le bien, aura meilleur que cela encore; et quiconque viendra avec le mal, (qu’il sache que) ceux qui commettront des méfaits ne seront rétribués que selon ce qu’ils ont commis.

**ChatGPT:**
The story of Qarun (Korah) is mentioned in the Quran and is part of Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions. The exact time of the story is not clearly specified, but it is believed to have occurred during the time of Moses, which is estimated to be around the 13th or 14th century BCE.
The location of the story is also not explicitly mentioned in the texts. However, since Qarun was part of Moses' people, it can be inferred that the events took place in the region where the Israelites lived during that time. This includes Egypt, where the Israelites were enslaved, and the Sinai Peninsula, where they wandered for 40 years after their exodus from Egypt.

Once upon a time, in a land of ancient times, there was a small village nestled between tall, majestic mountains and a crystal-clear river. The sun was just beginning to rise, casting a warm golden glow over the village, as birds happily chirped their morning songs. The people of the village were kind-hearted and hardworking, living simple lives filled with love and laughter. Every day, they would tend to their fields, care for their animals, and gather in the village square to share stories and play games with one another. The children were especially excited to hear tales of the past, filled with adventure and important lessons to learn. Little did they know that one such story was about to unfold right before their very eyes.
