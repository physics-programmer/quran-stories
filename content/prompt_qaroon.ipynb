Recall what time his people said unto him: exult not; verily God loveth not the exultant. (76) And seek the abode of the Hereafter with that which God hath vouchsafed thee, and forget not thy portion in the World, and be thou bounteous even as God hath been bounteous unto thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; verily Allah loveth not corrupters. (77) He said: I have been vouchsafed this only because of the knowledge that is with me. Knew he not that Allah had destroyed before him, of the generations, those who were stronger than he in might and larger in respect of following? And the culprits shall not be questioned of their sins. (78) Then he went forth unto his people in his pomp. Those who sought the life of the world said: would that we had the like of that which hath been vouchsafed unto Qarun! Verily he is the owner of a very great fortune. (79) And those who had been vouchsafed the knowledge said: woe unto you! the reward of Allah is best for him who believeth and worketh righteously and none shall attain it except the patient. (80) Then We sank the earth with him and his dwelling-place. And he had no host to defend him against Allah,nor was he of those who could defend themselves. (81) And those who had wished for his place but yesterday began to say: Ah! Allah expandeth the provision for whomsoever He will of His bondmen and stinteth, had not Allah been gracious unto us, He would have sunk the earth with us also. Ah! the infidels thrive not. (82) This is the abode of the Hereafter! We appoint it unto those who Seek not exaltation in the earth nor corruption; and the happy end is for the God-fearing. (83) Whosoever bringeth good shall have better than it, and whosoever bringeth evil, then those who do ill works shall be rewarded only for that which they have been working. (84) Verily He who hath imposed the Quran on thee Is surely about to bring thee back home. Say thou: my Lord knoweth best who bringeth guidance and who is in an error manifest. (85) And thou wast not hoping that the Book would be Inspired in thee; but it is a mercy from thy Lord, so be thou not a supporter of the infidels. (86) And let them not turn thee aside from the signs of Allah after they have been sent down unto thee. And call thou men unto thy Lord, and be thou not of the associaters.

    "Verily, Qârûn (Korah) was of Mûsâ's (Moses) people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We gave him of the treasures, that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men. Remember when his people said to him: \"Do not exult (with riches, being ungrateful to Allâh). Verily Allâh likes not those who exult (with riches, being ungrateful to Allâh). (76) But seek, with that (wealth) which Allâh has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world, and do good as Allâh has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily, Allâh likes not the Mufsidûn (those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupters). (77) He said: \"This has been given to me only because of knowledge I possess.\" Did he not know that Allâh had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount (of riches) they had collected? But the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) will not be questioned of their sins (because Allâh knows them well, so they will be punished without being called to account). (78) So he went forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: \"Ah, would that we had the like of what Qârûn (Korah) has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.\" (79) But those who had been given (religious) knowledge said: \"Woe to you! The Reward of Allâh (in the Hereafter) is better for those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and this none shall attain except those who are As-Sabirun (the patient in following the truth).\" (80) So We caused the earth to swallow him[] and his dwelling place. Then he had no group or party to help him against Allâh, nor was he one of those who could save themselves. (81) And those who had desired (for a position like) his position the day before, began to say: \"Know you not that it is Allâh Who enlarges the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His slaves. Had it not been that Allâh was Gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up (also)! Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful. (82) That home of the Hereafter (i.e. Paradise), We shall assign to those who rebel not against the truth with pride[] and oppression in the land nor do mischief by committing crimes. And the good end is for the Muttaqûn (pious righteous persons - see V.2:2). (83) Whosoever brings good (Islâmic Monotheism along with righteous deeds), he shall have the better thereof, and whosoever brings evil (polytheism along with evil deeds) then, those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do. (84) Verily, He Who has given you (O Muhammad SAW) the Qur'an (i.e. ordered you to act on its laws and to preach it to others) will surely bring you back to the Ma'âd (place of return, either to Makkah or to Paradise after your death, etc.). Say (O Muhammad SAW): \"My Lord is Aware of him who brings guidance, and of him who is in manifest error.\" (85) And you were not expecting that the Book (this Qur'ân) would be sent down to you, but it is a mercy from your Lord. So never be a supporter of the disbelievers. (86) And let them not turn you (O Muhammad SAW) away from (preaching) the Ayât (revelations and verses) of Allâh after they have been sent down to you: and invite (men) to (believe in) your Lord, and be not of Al-Mushrikûn (those who associate partners with Allâh, e.g. polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allâh and deny the Prophethood of Messenger Muhammad SAW). (87) And invoke not any other ilâh (god) along with Allâh, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Everything will perish save His Face. His is the Decision, and to Him you (all) shall be returned. (88) \n",

    "Indeed Qarun was from the people of Musa, 21 then he rebelled against them. And We had given to him such treasures as their keys would weigh too heavy for a strong group of people. (Remember) when his people said to him, “Do not exult. Surely, Allah does not like the exultant. (76) And seek the (betterment of) the Ultimate Abode with what Allah has given to you, and do not neglect your share from this world, and do good as Allah did good to you, and do not seek to make mischief in the land. Surely, Allah does not like the mischief-makers.” (77) He said, “This is given to me because of the knowledge (I have) with me.” Did he not know that Allah had destroyed, from the generations before him, those who were stronger than him in power and greater than him in multitude? And the sinners have not to be asked about their sins. 22 (78) Then (once) he came out before his people in his embellishment. Said those who are desirous of the worldly life, “Would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! He is a man of great fortune indeed.” (79) And said those who were given knowledge, “Woe to you, Allah's reward is much better for him who believes and acts righteously. But this is given to none but to those who observe restraint.” (80) Then We made him and his home sink into the earth. 23 So there was no group for him who could help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could defend themselves. (81) And those who wished to be in his position the day before, started saying, “Oh, it seems that Allah extends provision to whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Had Allah not favored us, He would have made us sink (too). Oh, it seems that the infidels do not succeed.” (82) As for that Ultimate Abode (the Hereafter), We assign it to those who do not intend haughtiness on earth nor mischief. And the (best) end is for the God-fearing. (83) Whoever brings good deed shall have better than it, and whoever brings evil deed, then those who commit evils shall not be punished except for what they used to do. (84) Surely the One who has enjoined the Qur'an upon you will surely bring you back to a place of return. 24 Say, “My Lord best knows the one who has come with guidance and the one who is in manifest error.” (85) You were not expecting that the Book would be sent down to you, but it was a mercy from your Lord. So, never be a supporter for the infidels. (86) And let them not prevent you from Allah's verses after they are sent down to you, and call (people) to your Lord, and never become one of those who associate partners with Allah. (87) And do not invoke any other god along with Allah. There is no god but He. Every thing is going to perish except His Face. He alone has the right to judge, and to Him you are to be returned.

    "Now Korah was of Moses' folk, but he oppressed them; and We gave him so much treasure that the stores thereof would verily have been a burden for a troop of mighty men. When his own folk said unto him: Exult not; lo! Allah loveth not the exultant; (76) But seek the abode of the Hereafter in that which Allah hath given thee and neglect not thy portion of the world, and be thou kind even as Allah hath been kind to thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; lo! Allah loveth not corrupters, (77) He said: I have been given it only on account of knowledge I possess. Knew he not that Allah had destroyed already of the generations before him men who were mightier than him in strength and greater in respect of following? The guilty are not questioned of their sins. (78) Then went he forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world said: Ah, would that unto us had been give like of what hath been given unto Korah! Lo! he is lord of rare good fortune. (79) But those who had been given knowledge said: Woe unto you! The reward of Allah for him who believeth and doeth right is better, and only the steadfast will obtain it. (80) So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling-place. Then he had no host to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who can save themselves. (81) And morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying: Ah, welladay! Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His slaves and straiteneth it (for whom He will). If Allah had not been gracious unto us He would have caused it to swallow us (also). Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never prosper. (82) As for that Abode of the Hereafter We assign it unto those who seek not oppression in the earth, nor yet corruption. The sequel is for those who ward off (evil). (83) Whoso bringeth a good deed, he will have better than the same; while as for him who bringeth an ill-deed, those who do ill-deeds will be requited only what they did. (84) Lo! He Who hath given thee the Qur'an for a law will surely bring thee home again. Say: My Lord is best aware of him who bringeth guidance and him who is in error manifest. (85) Thou hadst no hope that the Scripture would be inspired in thee; but it is a mercy from thy Lord, so never be a helper to the disbelievers. (86) And let them not divert thee from the revelations of Allah after they have been sent down unto thee; but call (mankind) unto thy Lord, and be not of those who ascribe partners (unto Him). (87) And cry not unto any other god along with Allah. There is no God save Him. Everything will perish save His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back. (88) \"\"\"\n",

Knew he not that Allah had destroyed before him, of the generations, those who were stronger than he in might and larger in respect of following? And the culprits shall not be questioned of their sins. (78) Then he went forth unto his people in his pomp. Those who sought the life of the world said: would that we had the like of that which hath been vouchsafed unto Qarun! Verily he is the owner of a very great fortune. (79) And those who had been vouchsafed the knowledge said: woe unto you! the reward of Allah is best for him who believeth and worketh righteously and none shall attain it except the patient. (80) Then We sank the earth with him and his dwelling-place. And he had no host to defend him against Allah,nor was he of those who could defend themselves. (81) And those who had wished for his place but yesterday began to say: Ah! Allah expandeth the provision for whomsoever He will of His bondmen and stinteth, had not Allah been gracious unto us, He would have sunk the earth with us also. Ah! the infidels thrive not. (82) This is the abode of the Hereafter! We appoint it unto those who Seek not exaltation in the earth nor corruption; and the happy end is for the God-fearing. (83) Whosoever bringeth good shall have better than it, and whosoever bringeth evil, then those who do ill works shall be rewarded only for that which they have been working. (84) Verily He who hath imposed the Quran on thee Is surely about to bring thee back home. Say thou: my Lord knoweth best who bringeth guidance and who is in an error manifest. (85) And thou wast not hoping that the Book would be Inspired in thee; but it is a mercy from thy Lord, so be thou not a supporter of the infidels. (86) And let them not turn thee aside from the signs of Allah after they have been sent down unto thee. And call thou men unto thy Lord, and be thou not of the associaters. (87) And invoke thou not any other god along with Allah. There is no god but he. Everything is perishable save His countenance His is the judgment, and unto Him ye shall be returned. (88) \\n\\nSecond English Version:\\n\\nVerily, Qârûn (Korah) was of Mûsâ\\'s (Moses) people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We gave him of the treasures, that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men. Remember when his people said to him: \"Do not exult (with riches, being ungrateful to Allâh). Verily Allâh likes not those who exult (with riches, being ungrateful to Allâh). (76) But seek, with that (wealth) which Allâh has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world, and do good as Allâh has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily, Allâh likes not the Mufsidûn (those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupters). (77) He said: \"This has been given to me only because of knowledge I possess.\" Did he not know that Allâh had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount (of riches) they had collected? But the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) will not be questioned of their sins (because Allâh knows them well, so they will be punished without being called to account). (78) So he went forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: \"Ah, would that we had the like of what Qârûn (Korah) has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.\" (79) But those who had been given (religious) knowledge said: \"Woe to you! The Reward of Allâh (in the Hereafter) is better for those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and this none shall attain except those who are As-Sabirun (the patient in following the truth).\" (80) So We caused the earth to swallow him[] and his dwelling place. Then he had no group or party to help him against Allâh, nor was he one of those who could save themselves. (81) And those who had desired (for a position like) his position the day before, began to say: \"Know you not that it is Allâh Who enlarges the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His slaves. Had it not been that Allâh was Gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up (also)! Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful. (82) That home of the Hereafter (i.e. Paradise), We shall assign to those who rebel not against the truth with pride[] and oppression in the land nor do mischief by committing crimes. And the good end is for the Muttaqûn (pious righteous persons - see V.2:2). (83) Whosoever brings good (Islâmic Monotheism along with righteous deeds), he shall have the better thereof, and whosoever brings evil (polytheism along with evil deeds) then, those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do. (84) Verily, He Who has given you (O Muhammad SAW) the Qur\\'an (i.e. ordered you to act on its laws and to preach it to others) will surely bring you back to the Ma\\'âd (place of return, either to Makkah or to Paradise after your death, etc.). Say (O Muhammad SAW): \"My Lord is Aware of him who brings guidance, and of him who is in manifest error.\" (85) And you were not expecting that the Book (this Qur\\'ân) would be sent down to you, but it is a mercy from your Lord. So never be a supporter of the disbelievers. (86) And let them not turn you (O Muhammad SAW) away from (preaching) the Ayât (revelations and verses) of Allâh after they have been sent down to you: and invite (men) to (believe in) your Lord, and be not of Al-Mushrikûn (those who associate partners with Allâh, e.g. polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allâh and deny the Prophethood of Messenger Muhammad SAW). (87) And invoke not any other ilâh (god) along with Allâh, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Everything will perish save His Face. His is the Decision, and to Him you (all) shall be returned. (88) \\n\\n\\nThird English Version:\\n\\nIndeed Qarun was from the people of Musa, 21 then he rebelled against them. And We had given to him such treasures as their keys would weigh too heavy for a strong group of people. (Remember) when his people said to him, “Do not exult. Surely, Allah does not like the exultant. (76) And seek the (betterment of) the Ultimate Abode with what Allah has given to you, and do not neglect your share from this world, and do good as Allah did good to you, and do not seek to make mischief in the land. Surely, Allah does not like the mischief-makers.” (77) He said, “This is given to me because of the knowledge (I have) with me.” Did he not know that Allah had destroyed, from the generations before him, those who were stronger than him in power and greater than him in multitude? And the sinners have not to be asked about their sins. 22 (78) Then (once) he came out before his people in his embellishment. Said those who are desirous of the worldly life, “Would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! He is a man of great fortune indeed.” (79) And said those who were given knowledge, “Woe to you, Allah\\'s reward is much better for him who believes and acts righteously. But this is given to none but to those who observe restraint.” (80) Then We made him and his home sink into the earth. 23 So there was no group for him who could help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could defend themselves. (81) And those who wished to be in his position the day before, started saying, “Oh, it seems that Allah extends provision to whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Had Allah not favored us, He would have made us sink (too). Oh, it seems that the infidels do not succeed.” (82) As for that Ultimate Abode (the Hereafter), We assign it to those who do not intend haughtiness on earth nor mischief. And the (best) end is for the God-fearing. (83) Whoever brings good deed shall have better than it, and whoever brings evil deed, then those who commit evils shall not be punished except for what they used to do. (84) Surely the One who has enjoined the Qur\\'an upon you will surely bring you back to a place of return. 24 Say, “My Lord best knows the one who has come with guidance and the one who is in manifest error.” (85) You were not expecting that the Book would be sent down to you, but it was a mercy from your Lord. So, never be a supporter for the infidels. (86) And let them not prevent you from Allah\\'s verses after they are sent down to you, and call (people) to your Lord, and never become one of those who associate partners with Allah. (87) And do not invoke any other god along with Allah. There is no god but He. Every thing is going to perish except His Face. He alone has the right to judge, and to Him you are to be returned. (88) \\n\\nFourth English Version:\\n\\nNow Korah was of Moses\\' folk, but he oppressed them; and We gave him so much treasure that the stores thereof would verily have been a burden for a troop of mighty men. When his own folk said unto him: Exult not; lo! Allah loveth not the exultant; (76) But seek the abode of the Hereafter in that which Allah hath given thee and neglect not thy portion of the world, and be thou kind even as Allah hath been kind to thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; lo! Allah loveth not corrupters, (77) He said: I have been given it only on account of knowledge I possess. Knew he not that Allah had destroyed already of the generations before him men who were mightier than him in strength and greater in respect of following? The guilty are not questioned of their sins. (78) Then went he forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world said: Ah, would that unto us had been give like of what hath been given unto Korah! Lo! he is lord of rare good fortune. (79) But those who had been given knowledge said: Woe unto you! The reward of Allah for him who believeth and doeth right is better, and only the steadfast will obtain it. (80) So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling-place. Then he had no host to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who can save themselves. (81) And morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying: Ah, welladay! Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His slaves and straiteneth it (for whom He will). If Allah had not been gracious unto us He would have caused it to swallow us (also). Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never prosper. (82) As for that Abode of the Hereafter We assign it unto those who seek not oppression in the earth, nor yet corruption. The sequel is for those who ward off (evil). (83) Whoso bringeth a good deed, he will have better than the same; while as for him who bringeth an ill-deed, those who do ill-deeds will be requited only what they did. (84) Lo! He Who hath given thee the Qur\\'an for a law will surely bring thee home again. Say: My Lord is best aware of him who bringeth guidance and him who is in error manifest. (85) Thou hadst no hope that the Scripture would be inspired in thee; but it is a mercy from thy Lord, so never be a helper to the disbelievers. (86) And let them not divert thee from the revelations of Allah after they have been sent down unto thee; but call (mankind) unto thy Lord, and be not of those who ascribe partners (unto Him). (87) And cry not unto any other god along with Allah. There is no God save Him. Everything will perish save His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back.

       "\n",
       "Once upon a time, in the city of Musa, lived a man named Qarun. Now, Qarun was no ordinary man. He had treasures beyond imagination, the keys of which were so heavy that even the strongest men of Musa found them a burden.\n",
       "\n",
       "Qarun had not always been a man of wealth. He was born into a humble family, but a stroke of luck had changed his life. However, with his new-found wealth, Qarun had also grown arrogant. He loved showing off his riches and took great pride in his treasures.\n",
       "\n",
       "One day, the wise people of Musa approached him. They said, \"Qarun, do not be so arrogant, for God does not favor the proud. Seek to do good in this world with the riches that God has bestowed upon you. Remember, the real treasure is not gold or silver but deeds of kindness and love.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But Qarun was unmoved. He arrogantly declared, \"It's my knowledge that has earned me these treasures.\" He believed it was his cleverness that had brought him all the riches, forgetting that it was God's blessing.\n",
       "\n",
       "One day, Qarun decided to show his wealth to the people of Musa. He paraded through the city with his treasures, and the people, in awe of his wealth, wished they could be as fortunate as him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seeing this, the wise men said, \"The reward of God is far superior for those who believe in Him and do righteous deeds. Wealth is temporary, but good deeds last forever.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Then something strange happened. The earth beneath Qarun's house started shaking, and suddenly, the ground opened up, swallowing him and all his treasures. The people of Musa watched in horror as Qarun, who had shown off his wealth just moments ago, vanished into the earth.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next morning, those who had envied Qarun's wealth realized the folly of their desires. They understood that it was not wealth but humility and good deeds that mattered.\n",
       "\n",
       "And so, the city of Musa learned a valuable lesson. They understood that arrogance and pride lead to downfall. They learned to value goodness and kindness over wealth and treasures.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the end, Qarun's story served as a reminder for all of us to remain humble, seek to do good in this world, and remember that the real treasures are not material wealth, but our deeds and the love we spread.\n",
       "\n",
       "And as the sun set over the city of Musa, the children slept, dreaming not of gold and silver but of acts of kindness and love they would spread when they woke up in the morning.\n",
